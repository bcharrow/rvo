# timeStep
# 	float (time)
# 	The time step of the simulation. Must be positive.
# maxNeighbors
# 	size_t
# 	The maximal number of other agents the agent takes into account in the
# 	navigation. The larger this number, the longer the running time of the
# 	simulation. If the number is too low, the simulation will not be safe.
# maxSpeed
# 	float (distance/time)
# 	The maximum speed of the agent. Must be non-negative.
# neighborDist
# 	float (distance)
# 	The maximal distance (center point to center point) to other agents the
# 	agent takes into account in the navigation. The larger this number, the
# 	longer the running time of the simulation. If the number is too low,
# 	the simulation will not be safe. Must be non-negative.
# radius
# 	float (distance)
# 	The radius of the agent. Must be non-negative.
# timeHorizon
# 	float (time)
# 	The minimal amount of time for which the agent's velocities that are
# 	computed by the simulation are safe with respect to other agents. The
# 	larger this number, the sooner this agent will respond to the presence
# 	of other agents, but the less freedom the agent has in choosing its
# 	velocities. Must be positive.
# timeHorizonObst
# 	float (time)
# 	The minimal amount of time for which the agent's velocities that are
# 	computed by the simulation are safe with respect to obstacles. The
# 	larger this number, the sooner this agent will respond to the presence
# 	of obstacles, but the less freedom the agent has in choosing its
# 	velocities. Must be positive.
